### Important:

> 1. Iterator is a behavioral design pattern that lets you traverse elements of a collection without exposing its
     underlying representation (list, stack, tree, etc.).
> 2. Sequentially access the elements of a collection

## Description

## Structure

## How to use

1. Use the Iterator pattern when your collection has a complex data structure under the hood, but you want to hide its
   complexity from clients (either for convenience or security reasons).
2. Use the pattern to reduce duplication of the traversal code across your app.
3. Use the Iterator when you want your code to be able to traverse different data structures or when types of these
   structures are unknown beforehand.
